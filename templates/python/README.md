# Python Templates

This folder contains some templates you can copy and use for your own function implementation.

If you are expecting CloudEvents for your function, check out the `cloudevent` folder. If you're expecting HTTP only for your function, check out the `http` folder.

For more details on how to customize your function, take a look at the python buildpack's readme's [`project.toml`](../../buildpacks/python/README.md#project.toml) and [function parameters](../../buildpacks/python/README.md#fp).
