# Java Templates

This folder contains some templates you can copy and use for your own function implementation.

If you are expecting CloudEvents for your function, check out the `cloudevents` options. If you're expecting HTTP only for your function, check out the `http` options.

Likewise, choose `gradle` or `maven` to match your dependency management preferences.

For more details on how to customize your function, take a look at the samples folder in the root directory.
